# game code

intention:
* developing a toy game using platform independent engine

table of contents (in include order by program file):
* `/defs.hpp` constants used by engine and game objects
* `/resources/*` partial files defining tiles, sprites, palettes and tile map
* `/game.hpp` game state used by objects
* `/objects/*` game objects
* `/main.hpp` setup initial game state, callbacks from engine, game logic

# overview

## main.hpp
### function `main_setup`
* initiates the game by creating initial objects and sets tile map position and velocity
### function `main_on_touch_screen`
* handles user interaction with touch screen
### function `main_on_frame_completed`
* implements game logic

## objects/*
* implements game objects

## game.hpp
* contains game state
* included by objects that access game state
* game state used in `main_on_frame_completed` solving circular reference problems

## resources/*
* files generated by tool in `utils/png-to-resources`
* separate palettes for tiles and sprites
* 256 sprite images is default although more can be implemented by modifying `utils/png-to-resources`
* 256 tiles is default and maximum without changing definitions in engine
* tile map size user defined in `defs.hpp`

## defs.hpp
### `enum object_class`
* each game object class has an entry named with suffix `_cls`
### `collision_bits`
* naming bits with constants
* constants used by objects to define collision bits and mask
### `object_instance_max_size_B`
* maximum size of any game object instance
* set to 256B but should be maximum game object instance size rounded upwards to nearest power of 2 number

## limitations
* due to target device not being able to allocate large (>128KB) chunks of contiguous memory some limitations are imposed
* concurrent sprites limited to 255 due to collision map having to be 8-bit to fit the screen pixels in a contiguous block of memory
* concurrent objects limited to 255 being a natural sizing considering sprites
* limits can be modified by changing definitions in `engine.hpp`
