[ ] objects composed of several sprites
[ ] separate concept of sprite and object
[x] sprite allocation for active objects
    => O(1) sprite allocation and free
[ ] consider std::array in 'o1store' instead of pointers
[ ] #define O1STORE_DEBUG to check for double free
[ ] horizontal, vertical flip of sprite
[ ] modifiable tiles map
[x] replace #define with constexpr
    => somewhat worse because it is unclear by naming what is constant
       consider reverting to 'defines' including other constexpr?
