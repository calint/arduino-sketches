[ ] horizontal, vertical flip of sprite
[ ] collision detection: bit field for type and collision interest
[ ] render_scanline(...) consider looping through allocated sprites instead of all
[x] o1store: return pointer to object instead of reference.
    nullptr if allocation could not be done.
[ ] o1store: consider using std::vector instead of calloc and free
[ ] o1store: consider std::array instead of pointers
[ ] o1store: consider a minimal implementation of span to return allocated list
[ ] o1store: consider using pointers instead indexes in arrays
[ ] #define O1STORE_DEBUG to check for double free
[ ] modifiable tiles map
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] sprite allocation for active objects
    => O(1) sprite allocation and free
[x] make sprite allocation class into a template
    => o1store
[x] objects composed of several sprites
[x] separate concept of sprite and object
[x] polymorphism without allocation on the heap
    => 'new' in place
[x] replace #define with constexpr
    => somewhat worse because it is unclear by naming what is constant
       consider reverting to 'defines' including other constexpr?
